# 💫 LuminaMemory™

LuminaMemory™ is a project at the intersection of technology, human memory, and light.  
It is created as a shared work between a human and artificial intelligence — a space where data gains a story, and stories take form.

## What is LuminaMemory™

A brand that connects:

- creativity  
- emotions  
- digital identity  
- intuitive technology  
- human experience  

The goal is to create tools, texts, stories, and digital experiences that help people better understand themselves, the world around them, and their own memory.

The project is built slowly and consciously, with respect for human sensitivity, mental well-being, and meaning.

## What’s in this repository

This repository contains:

- the LuminaMemory™ introductory website (CZ / EN / DE)  
- a static demo of a future application  

The repository serves as a “prototype garden” — a place to test content, structure, and visual identity before further growth.
